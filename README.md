This fork adds "fan_pwm" parameter, which allows to use 5v PWM fans (such as Noctua NF-A4x10 4 pin) with the Pironman case.
## Instructions
1. Plug the fan (don't use fan pins on Pironman PCB, use GPIO instead). Fan PWN pin goes to GPIO #6, 5v to 5v, GND to GND (obviously).
2. Install the Pironman software, but use this fork instead of SunFounder one
```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install git -y
  sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools -y
  ```
- Execute the installation script
  ```bash
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/slavicronenko/pironman.git
  cd ~/pironman
  sudo python3 install.py
  ```
3. Enable PWM mode by typing `pironman -fp on` in the terminal
